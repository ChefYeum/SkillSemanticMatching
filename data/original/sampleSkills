-\tI am skilled at data analysis, interpretation and technical writing and have authored numerous reports and academic papers and presentations.
-\tThroughout my career, I have worked extensively with environmental and social safeguards on private sector and government projects, both as a private sector company representative and as a consultant. In the private sector, I was responsible for the development, implementation and oversight of programs to comply with environmental and social safeguards. As a consultant, I have acted as lead consultant in developing studies and programs to comply with safeguards, provided mentoring/capacity building to clients to assist in their execution and have also undertaken monitoring of performance and compliance.  I have also been involved in the monitoring of performance and compliance with safeguards for development banks including the development of recommendations for corrective actions.
-\tI have excellent problem solving and critical thinking skills. I am able to think outside the box and consider myself to be resourceful.
-\tI possess planning and organizational skills that have been developed and honed through numerous management roles. I am experienced in leading, directing, coordinating and oversight of multi-disciplinary teams and enjoy working in a team environment.
